## Dataset
### General information
The dataset used in this assignment is the training set of the ["House Prices"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) dataset provided by Kaggle. The dataset comes with file providing the full description of each column *data_description.txt*. Both files are located in the *data* folder, as requested in the assignment. The dataset is meant to be used in a competition on Kaggle to predict the final prices of a dataset of houses in Ames, Iowa. As a matter of fact, the 79 explanatory variables give a comprehensive description of the most significant aspects of the average residential home.

As explained in the subsection below, the column description will be used to select the most relevant features of the dataset on which the Exploratory Data Analysis will be conducted.

### Dataset description
```{r  echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#Import statements
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
```
The file is read into `houses` and only the most relevant columns are selected.
```{r results='hide'}
houses <- read_csv("data/train.csv") %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(c(MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotShape, LandContour, Neighborhood, Condition1,
           Condition2, OverallQual, OverallCond, YearBuilt, MoSold, YrSold))
```

Summaries of relevant numeric variables
```{r echo=FALSE}
summaries <- houses %>% 
  select(c(MSSubClass, OverallQual, OverallCond, YearBuilt, MoSold, YrSold)) %>% 
  summary()
print(summaries)
```

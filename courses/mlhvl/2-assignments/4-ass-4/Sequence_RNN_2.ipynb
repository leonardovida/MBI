    "## Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks are a particularly interesting class of neural networks. Unlike standard fully-connected networks, which accept a fixed-size input and produce a fixed-size output over a predefined number of computational steps (i.e. network layers), RNNs instead operate on sequences of vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, feedforward networks may be seen as a trainable (but parametrically fixed) function, whereas RNNs act as continuous, stateful programs operating on sequences of inputs. \n",
    "Cognitively, this may be viewed as enhancing our system's perceptive and computational abilities with a notion of memory.\n",
    "In the general case, this statefulness is captured by an intermediate hidden vector which is adjusted throughout the computation, affected by both the immediately previous version of itself __and__ the current input.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are nowadays established as the core machinery of neural sequence processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple recurrent network (SRN or Elman network) is described by the equations:\n",
    "* $h_t = \\theta_h (W_h x_t + U_h h_{t-1} + b_h ) $\n",
    "* $y_t = \\theta_y (W_y h_t + b_y) $\n",

In this context, feedforward networks process all the relevant aspects of an example at once by employing fixed-size input vectors (with associated weights). The approach of the feedforward network makes it difficult to deal with sequences of varying length and fails to capture temporal aspects of the language. One workaround is using a fixed-sized windows of tokens as input and sliding these windows over the input while making prediction. However, this window-based method has some drawbacks:\n",
    "* It limits the context from which information can be extracted to the *window-size* \"length\";\n",

RNN process words sequences a word at a time predicting the next word in a sentence by using the current words and the previous hiddent state as input, thus avoiding the context constraints of feedforward networks."
